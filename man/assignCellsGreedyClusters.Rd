\usage{
assignCellsGreedyClusters(netx.pred, cell.types, target.cls.counts)
}
\arguments{
\item{netx.pred}{A numeric matrix of predicted probabilities, with rows representing cells
and columns representing clusters. Row names must be cell IDs, and column names must be cluster IDs.}

\item{cell.types}{A character or factor vector of cell type labels, one per cell.
The length must equal the number of rows in netx.pred. Names should correspond to cell IDs.}

\item{target.cls.counts}{A numeric data frame or matrix of required cell counts,
with rows representing clusters and columns representing cell types.
Each entry gives how many cells of a specific type should be assigned to a specific cluster.
Row names must include all cluster IDs from netx.pred.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\itemize{
\item assigned_cluster: a named list mapping each cluster ID to the vector of assigned cell IDs
\item assigned_types: a matrix of cluster by cell type showing how many cells of each type were assigned
\item target_quota: the original target count matrix aligned to clusters and cell types
\item leftover_cap: an integer vector giving remaining unfilled capacity per cluster
\item leftover_quota: a matrix of remaining unfilled per-type quotas (cluster by cell type)
}
}
\description{
Greedy assignment of single cells to clusters while respecting per-cluster and per-cell-type
target counts. Cells are processed in order of their maximum prediction score, and each cell
is placed into the most likely cluster that still has quota for its type.
